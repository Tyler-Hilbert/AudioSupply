Not using any plugins, templates, or pre-made repositories, can you create a small webapp that does the following:  

1) Has a product page  
2) Has a product gallery containing multiple products  
3) A customer can add a product to their cart  
4) A customer can check out and ‘pay’ for a product (using a payment platform of your choice, obviously using a development API).  
5) The admin can view orders placed and mark them as shipped.  
6) The order’s payment is only distributed after the order is marked as shipped.  
7) Each payment is split between two different receiving accounts: 10% to ‘Platform’ account and 90% to ‘Admin’ account.
